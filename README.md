# wordle-copilot

A copilot for Wordle. Enter your guesses, mark letters yellow or green by clicking on them, let the copilot tell you how you're doing (or help you solve if you're stuck).

I coded this (I kid you not) mostly on my iPad while in bed, typing on the touchscreen, using Stackblitz. I guess it can be done. Some cleanup later on the Mac, that's also where I commented the code in the hopes I might still understand it in two weeks.
