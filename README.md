# wordle-copilot

A copilot for Wordle. Enter your guesses, mark letters yellow or green by clicking on them, let the copilot tell you how you're doing (or help you solve if you're stuck).

I coded the first working version (I kid you not) mostly on my iPad while in bed, typing on the touchscreen, using Stackblitz. Not that I recommend that, necessarily, but I guess it can be done. 

I did significant cleanup and a rewrite later on the Mac, so that's that.
